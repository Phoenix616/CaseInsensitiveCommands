# CaseInsensitiveCommands

Bukkit plugin to make all commands lowercase to allow upper case commands in 1.19+ (it requires lowercase)

## How it works

- `/Command Argument` -> `/command Argument`
- `/COMMAND Argument` -> `/command Argument`
- `Normal Chat Text` -> `Normal Chat Text` (stays untouched)
